# Customer_Detail_Dashboard

In this project, I created Customer Detail Dashbloard to answer business questions.

The following steps were taken to get the final result:

1. Data Transformation : The Datasets were properly transformed for deeper analytics.

2. Data Modelling: Because there are about 7 different tables of the datasets, Data model was done to establish the relationship among the tables.

3. DAX : Simple and Complex Dax functions were used to generate insights from the dataset; both Calculated columns and measures.

4. Dashborad creation: The insights generated were displayed on a dashboard using suitable charts for each information to convey the key findings.
